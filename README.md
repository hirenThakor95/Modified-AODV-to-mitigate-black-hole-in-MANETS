# The .tcl files are designed for the NS2 simulation, this is a proof of concept and not the actual implementation of the aodv protocol. # I will update it later. 

# You have to setup NS2/3 Simulator on any machine, I used the virtual Ubuntu machine. maybe this will help --> https://networksimulationtools.com/how-to-install-ns3-in-ubuntu-18-04/
The first simulation is for the blackhole attack in the controlled environment. To run this simulation you have to type 'ns' command and the filename which is blackhole.tcl. 

The measure that used in this project are throughput, delay and pdr.
